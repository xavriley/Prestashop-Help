		<p>Based in <b>Guildford</b>, we specialise in optimising <b>Prestashop</b> to get the most out your online business. Since 2009, we've been working with UK businesses to help them solve their ecommerce problems. With transparent, fixed-cost pricing and work commenced within days of commission, you could be closer than you think to getting Prestashop running the way you want.</p>
		<p>Services we offer include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Speed Optimisation</b>- don't leave your customers waiting around. Snappy sites mean happier customer and increased sales but how do you know where to start? From our research, some of the Prestashop speed 'enhancements' actually <b>slow down</b> your site. We perform a two stage process to fix this. First, we profile the site's front-end and back-end code to identify exactly where the site is slowing down. Second, we address these one-by-one and produce a detailed account of the work undertaken so you can be confident in knowing how well your site is running.</li>
			<li><b>Site Search Optimisation / Sphinx Integration</b>- your site search is one of your <b>most important sales tools</b>. How you handle search queries, especially with large product catalogues, can make or break your customer experience. We are leading specialists in integrating the free open-source <a href="http://www.sphinxsearch.com/" target="_blank">Sphinx Search Engine</a> into Prestashop sites, and the results speak for themselves. A search of over 90,000 products gives complete and accurate results within 0.5 seconds. Talk to us today about taking your site search beyond your customer's expectations.</li>
			<li><b>SEO</b>- you already know how important it is to get your products listing high on Google, but other 'specialist' companies are out of your price range. Because we know Prestashop inside-out, we're  able to deliver cost-effective changes that will impact your rankings in less time than you think. No lengthy meetings and policy documents - just well built sites and good advice.</li>
			<li><b>Hosting and Server maintenance</b>- as a business owner, you don't want to waste time and money dealing with server issues. You just want it to work. We have years of experience dealing with all the flavours of Linux hosting, PHP and MySQL issues that might crop up and we can probably get you back up and running faster than you think. We can also consult on backup policies and advise you on which server packages suit your needs.</li>
		</ul>
